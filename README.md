# Scalable Microservices Deployment Strategy with Git Branching and Environment Isolation

## Overview
This document outlines a DevSecOps-driven environment and branching strategy to support scalable, independent microservice development across multiple Scrum teams. The goal is to enable parallel feature development, testing, and deployment with minimal conflicts, using both static and ephemeral environments.

## Goals
- Allow each team to independently develop, test, and deploy features.
- Prevent feature testing from blocking other teams.
- Use a shared Kubernetes cluster efficiently.
- Track cloud infrastructure resources per feature and environment.
- Maintain consistent promotion from development to production.

## Git Branching Strategy

### Branch Types
| Branch           | Purpose                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `main`           | Production-ready code                      |
| `release/stage`  | Final staging environment                  |
| `release/uat`    | UAT sign-off phase                         |
| `feature/*`      | Individual feature development             |

### Where are Feature Branches Created From?
- **Feature branches are created from `main`.**
- This ensures that the new feature starts from the latest stable codebase.
- It avoids pulling in untested or incomplete code from UAT or Stage branches.
- Promotes better isolation and fewer merge conflicts downstream.

```bash
# Example:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-discount-module
```

### Lifecycle Flow
1. Developer creates `feature/*` branch from `main`.
2. CI/CD pipeline triggers build and test. By default, the feature is deployed to the shared `dev` or `qa` environment depending on the team workflow.
3. For critical or resource-heavy features, an ephemeral environment is created to isolate the testing and ensure reliability without impacting shared environments.
4. Once approved, the feature branch is merged to `release/uat` for UAT testing.
5. After UAT approval, it is merged to `release/stage` for final validation.
6. Final merge to `main` triggers deployment to production.

         ├──> Dev / QA Env (shared)
         └──> Ephemeral Env (if critical or isolated)
                    │
                    └──> merge to release/uat ───> UAT Env
                                          │
                                          └──> release/stage ───> Stage Env
                                                                  │
                                                                  └──> main ───> Prod
```

## Kubernetes Environments

### Static Environments
| Environment | Purpose                            | Characteristics                   |
|-------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `dev`       | Shared for basic testing           | Shared namespace per team         |
| `qa`        | Shared integration testing         | Shared with minimal coupling      |
| `uat`       | UAT sign-off                       | Mirrors stage environment         |
| `stage`     | Final testing before production    | Mirrors production setup          |
| `prod`      | Live user traffic                  | High availability, hardened infra |

### Ephemeral Environments
- Created dynamically for `feature/*` branches.
- Namespace: `feature-<id>-<name>`
- Deployed with dedicated infra:
  - DB: `orders-feature456-db`
  - Queue: `orders-feature456-queue`
  - Bucket: `orders-feature456-bucket`
- Auto-destroyed after PR merge/close or TTL expiry.

## Mapping Branches to Environments

| Git Branch      | Deployed To                   | Type      | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `feature/*`      | `dev` / `qa` / Ephemeral Env  | Mixed     | Initially deployed to shared `dev` or `qa`. For critical or resource-heavy features, ephemeral environments are created for isolated testing. |
| `release/uat`    | `uat`                          | Static    | Business validation                                          |
| `release/stage`  | `stage`                        | Static    | Final QA and performance testing                             |
| `main`           | `prod`                         | Static    | Production deployment                                        |

## Cloud Infra Management (DB, Buckets, Queues, etc.)

- Provisioned via Terraform/Terragrunt.
- Unique naming convention per environment and feature:
  - `orders-feature123-db`, `orders-uat-db`, `orders-prod-db`
- Tagged for traceability (feature ID, team name, env).
- Secrets/configs managed with Vault/Secrets Manager.
- CI/CD injects environment-specific secrets during deployment.

---

## CI/CD & GitOps Tools and Structure

### GitLab CI or Jenkins Pipeline Structure
- **Stages:**
  - `init`: Checkout code, set environment variables.
  - `lint`: Run linters and basic static analysis.
  - `test`: Run unit/integration tests.
  - `build`: Build Docker images, tag with commit SHA or feature ID.
  - `scan`: Run security scans (Trivy, SonarQube).
  - `deploy-dev`: Deploy to `dev` or ephemeral env (using Helm/Kustomize).
  - `deploy-uat`: Triggered on merge to `release/uat`.
  - `deploy-stage`: Triggered on merge to `release/stage`.
  - `deploy-prod`: Triggered on merge to `main`.

### Kubernetes Manifest Repos (kubemanifest)
- Store all application deployment YAMLs or Helm values.
- Folder structure:
  ```
  kubemanifest/
    ├── base/ (common templates)
    ├── overlays/
    │   ├── dev/
    │   ├── qa/
    │   ├── feature-123/
    │   ├── uat/
    │   ├── stage/
    │   └── prod/
  ```
- Secrets and configMaps defined per environment.
- Managed by GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux).

### ArgoCD Integration
- ArgoCD watches the `kubemanifest/overlays/*` directories.
- Syncs changes automatically or manually based on config.
- Provides a dashboard to view status, history, diffs, and rollbacks.
- Can be connected to GitLab/Jenkins pipelines for automated promotions.

## Feature Testing Workflow Example
1. Dev creates branch `feature/login-revamp` from `main`.
2. CI/CD pipeline provisions infra and deploys to `feature-login-revamp` namespace.
3. QA validates via `feature-login.qa.company.com`.
4. Merge to `release/uat` → deployed to UAT.
5. Merge to `release/stage` → deployed to staging.
6. Merge to `main` → deployed to production.

## Q&A

**Q: Why separate Git branches from deployment environments?**  
A: Git represents code lifecycle, not runtime infra. Mapping branches to environments allows better control over promotion flows.

**Q: Is ephemeral env setup expensive?**  
A: TTL-based cleanup ensures cost optimization. We also restrict resource sizes in these envs.

**Q: What if two features of the same service are in different stages?**  
A: We isolate features in their own ephemeral envs. They merge independently into UAT, then into stage and production.

---

## Summary
- Branch lifecycle controls code readiness.
- Environment lifecycle controls runtime testing and release.
- Combining static + ephemeral environments allows scale and flexibility.
- GitOps + Terraform ensures infra and app are always in sync.
